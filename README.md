### Hey there!

- Currently, I'm learning the all around basics of computer science. I am also working through the Odin Project, CS50x, and CS 303E at the University of Texas at Austin.
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on hackathons both digital and in-person (Austin,TX), as well as other projects that even a beginner could contribute to!
- As of right now you can reach me through Github!
